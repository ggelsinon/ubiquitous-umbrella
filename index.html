                <h2>Bio by Tim Sendra</h2>
                     <p>Childish Gambino is the hip-hop alter ego of multi-hyphenate American entertainer Donald Glover, who is also known for acting roles on television shows like Community and the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning Atlanta, as well as the film Solo: A Star Wars Story. As Childish Gambino, Glover refined his off-kilter brand of hip-hop on his 2013 breakthrough album Because the Internet, before making a sharp turn toward R&B-inspired funk, which won him a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance in 2017 for the single "Redbone." In 2018, his politically charged song "This Is America" debuted at number one atop the Billboard Hot 100, buoyed by a viral music video that addressed gun violence and racial injustice.
